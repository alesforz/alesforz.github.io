resume_header_intro: >
  <p>Hey there!
  I'm a software engineer excited about transforming innovative research projects into reality.
  I thrive in a collaborative environment and enjoy working with both researchers and business teams to turn abstract ideas into practical solutions.
  You'll often find me knee-deep in creating software using Go, which is my favorite programming language! My expertise lies in secure distributed systems and I'm continuously eager to expand my knowledge and skills. My contributions haven't gone unnoticed: my work has been recognized through awards and patents that I'm really proud of.<br>
  When I'm not programming, you'll find me exploring different worlds through books, baking gluten-free stuff, or attempting to lift heavy things (and then putting them down).<br>
  I'm always on the lookout for the next big challenge and a fresh cup of espresso to start my day!<br><br>
  So, what brings you here today?</p>
